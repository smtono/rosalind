# Queenie
My discord bot, and yet only a fragmented soul from the real deal

## What can I do with this?
There is no one use for this bot, I simply explore concepts I want to know more about and add them to her. Some of these include:
- Chat feature
- Compiling DogeSpeak code
- Searching the internet
- Playing music via YouTube links
- Random stuff dealing with user input

## How can I use this for my stuff?
While this is fine-tuned to my own needs, there are ways to use this yourself
Firstly, change authentication.txt in the resources folder to your bot's token and your ID
You can change the sample_script.txt in that folder also to better suit how you want your bot to talk
